What does Mr. Bird like?
Do you want any meat today, Mrs. Bird?
Yes,please.
Do you want beef or lamb?
Beef,please.
This lamb's very good.
I like lamb, but my husband doesn't.
What about some steak? This is nice piece.
Give me that piece, please. And a pound of mice, too.
Do you want a chicken, Mrs. Bird. They're very nice.
No,thank you. My husband likes steak, but he doesn't like chicken.
To tell you the truth, Mrs. Bird, I don't like chicken, either!
