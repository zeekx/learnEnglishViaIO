I don't know anyone at this party.
There is a strange man.
He has a big nose and small ears.
I don't know him.
There are two women.
They are wearing glasses.
I don't know them, either.
There is a cute young girl.
She has long hair and fair skin.
She is dancing with someone.
I like her, but everyone else does, too.
